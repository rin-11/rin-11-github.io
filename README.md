My game is a canvas style player running game.

The user plays as a rat and has to use the left, right, and up key to get through the streets while avoiding coliding with cats, traps, and poison.

The goal is to make it through the game in two minutes without getting a score higher than 500.

Post-MPV Goals
       - Add animations 
       - Fix the collision method to subtract character specific hit points
       - Turn gameover/win alerts into pop-up windows
